## Fishing

### Blackmouth

Region 10 closed early for 2019; always check [the bulletins](https://fortress.wa.gov/dfw/erules/efishrules/rules_current_order_by_date.j)
 

* From [blackmouth fishing page](http://salmonuniversity.com/archives/444) at [salmon university](http://salmonuniversity.com)
  * blackmouth are juvenile chinook; this concerns winter fishing
    * 5 - 15 pound fish chasing herring and candle fish (and maybe squid?) near the bottom in 50 -- 150 feet depth
    * 22 inches minimum length; spots on upper and lower tail; big spots on back; dark mouth; black gums; large sharp teeth
    * hatchery only, no wild; healed scar of clipped adipose fin
  * fishing
    * San Juans recommended, with places to fish on both the flood and ebb tides
      * Ideal condition are moderate tides when the exchange is about a foot per hour
    * 2 - 2.5 mph SOG on average: with the current (chinook are active pursuit fish)
  * Downrigger trolling: From downrigger to flasher to bait to hooks... maybe to a fish
    * "...trolling we focus on targeting the bottom and aren’t afraid to make contact with our downrigger weights fairly often. Flasher and spoon, and flasher and hoochie have been the go to technique on the troll."
    * downrigger
      * 10 - 20 feet off the bottom
      * 20-30 degree angle on the wire recommended
        * This suggests a handy table of cosines and an angle template
      * bigger fish are below the 'shakers'
      * Triangle flasher idea: Goes above/near downrigger ball
        * [silver horde triangle](https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Horde-13-Rudder-Flasher/dp/B00SZ4YUHM/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=silver+horde+flasher&qid=1547999629&s=Sports+%26+Outdoors&sr=1-3)
        * upper corner to cable, lower corner to ball, rear corner to downrigger clip
        * described in [this video](https://youtu.be/jUFoPzkyNKE) to stabilize downrigger ball tracking and attract fish
    * flasher
      * UV / white / green; some go as far as fluorescent or attaching little lights
      * [11" ProTroll](https://www.amazon.com/inch-Pro-Troll-Hot-Chip-Flashers/dp/B00D989JJI/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=flasher+protroll&qid=1548000400&s=Sports+%26+Outdoors&sr=1-14)
        * Some of these ProTrolls have lights ($$$) and some claim to have chips that mimic bait fish electrical........
      * Also some anecdotal support for smaller 8 inch flashers
      * Line-twist with spoon-and-flasher: Size 3 Sampo or Berkley ball-bearing swivel in-line about a foot above the flasher 
        * Up a bit so as not to impede the action of an attractor or lure by adding too much weight directly to it
        * ...so the swivel goes up the line a ways rather than using a snap-swivel attached directly to the top of the flasher
        * ...but not so far above the flasher that the rig is too long; harder to land a fish
    * lures
      * a lot of what i see starts by recommending spoons
        * downrigger -- 15 feet -- 11" ProTroll flasher -- 26 -- 36" leader -- spoon + scent + garlic powder
        * [Coho Killer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0778YSFJH/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=AGEU5BOCQ1AB8&psc=1)
          * "Finish" recs include Irish Cream, Cookies N Cream, Water Melon, Chrome, White Lightning
        * Sonic Edge spoons maybe? as similar to old-style Coyotes; anecdotal
        * Bigger bait? 
          * [Ace Hi Fly with UV finish](https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Horde-Ace-Fly-Lures/dp/B00AU5W72E/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ace+hi+fly&qid=1547854281&s=Sports+%26+Outdoors&sr=1-2-catcorr)
            * This is related to Jeramy's rig?
        * Calamari plugs (?) 10 feet higher than above; no flasher; 40 feet behind the downrigger
        * [Irish Flag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CZDPK0U/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_1?smid=A3UMG32GFS0Y7X&psc=1) 
          * 3.5" or 4" spoon also from Silver Horde
          * See above on finishes people like (no word from the salmon on what they like)
        * Replace the standard King Fisher spoon with the “Tail Wagger” Hoochie Hook with #15 Octopus Squid Skirt on the hook
          * slow the spoon’s action at a faster trolling speed.
        * Needlefish Hoochie or Needlefish Ace-Hi Fly in a green spatter back finish. 
          * With tandem-tied 4/0 Owner SSW Cutting Point hooks 32 inches behind an 11-inch flasher
        * bait: particularly green-label / plug-cut herring
          * tandem-tied 3/0 or 3/0-4/0 Owner Cutting Point hooks tied on 20-pound monofilament leader material.       
          * 7- to 9-foot leader with a Sampo or Penn ball-bearing swivel in the middle and a No. 5 barrel swivel at the top end
            * for quick connection to the ball-bearing swivel and Duo-Lock snap at the end of his main line
          * Another plug cut green-label style is...
            * 2 Mustad UltraPoint hooks so that it spins in a tight circle even at slow speed. 
            * 3/0 hook in front and a 2/0 in back. 
            * A six-foot leader of Berkley Big Game UltraClear or 15-pound fluorocarbon runs to...
            * a swivel that connects leader to main line
              * six-bead swivel chains 
              * if 2 or 3 become tangled with grass the others will continue to work and reduce or eliminate line twist
            * Snap line into downrigger release about 25 feet behind the ball (seems to be no-flasher)
            * fish with the current five to 10 feet off the bottom whenever and wherever possible 
        * 3.5-inch or 4-inch Coyote Spoon 
          * chartreuse/fish-scale finish (color #0580) behind an 11-inch Pro-Troll HotChip Flasher in Green Stryper
          * About 42 inches of 30-pound Berkley Big Game UltraClear monofilament to flasher
          * little Smelly Jelly (usually herring or anchovy scent on the concave (chrome) side of the spoon
          * ...and a little more near the tail end of the flasher.
    * hooks
      * [This article](http://salmonuniversity.com/archives/3736) is interesting
      * Sharp sharp shar: Three-sided point, use sharpener, inspect hooks always
      * Single: Matsuo sickle hooks recommended
      * Pair of singles: Mustad’s 92553 octopus hook
        * Top hook right behind the head of the bait or lure
        * Bottom hook slightly behind the tail end of the lure
  * Alternative: Mooching rig described in a fishing report 
    * Green or red label herring, plug cut, on a 3/0 – 2/0 Gamakatsu octopus hooks, light 20lb leader
      * Extra bit of spin on the light leader and small hooks. 
      * Leader length is 6’
      * Catching at or near the bottom both on the drop and also the retrieve...
        * ...but we have caught many fish near the surface so fish throughout the entire water column      





#### Landed fish

- stun with a billy club, not kill 
- bleed: scissors to cut the gills on both sides of the fish’s head (or knife)
- bleeding line attached to the side of the boat, so fish is just under the water along side
  - close to boat; not trolling for seals
- after 15 minutes move fish to a cool fish box on ice if necessary until ready to clean
  - Exception: A pink / Humpy: Clean immediately and pack in ice to keep the flesh firm
- End of the fishing day clean the fish whole or fillet it
- Place in a sealed fish bag packed in ice for trip home
- At home: trim the fish up, re-wash; and either eat it within a day or vacuum pack it and freeze it to smoke later
