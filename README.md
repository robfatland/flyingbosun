    * juvenile chinook
      * 5 - 15 pound juveniles chasing herring and candle fish (and maybe squid?) near the bottom in 50 -- 150 feet depth
      * 22 inches minimum length; spots on upper and lower tail; big spots on back; dark mouth; black gums; large sharp teeth
      * hatchery only, no wild; healed scar of clipped adipose fin
    * fishing
      * San Juans recommended, with places to fish on both the flood and ebb tides
        * Ideal condition are moderate tides when the exchange is about a foot per hour
      * 2 - 2.5 mph SOG on average: with the current (chinook are active pursuit fish)
    * downrigger
      * 10 - 20 feet off the bottom
      * 20-30 degree angle on the wire recommended
        * This suggests a handy table of cosines and an angle template
      * bigger fish are below the 'shakers'
      * Triangle flasher idea: Goes above/near downrigger ball

        * upper corner to cable, lower corner to ball, rear corner to downrigger clip
        * described in [this video](https://youtu.be/jUFoPzkyNKE) to stabilize downrigger ball tracking and attract fish
    * flasher
      * UV / white / green; some go as far as fluorescent or attaching little lights
      * [11" ProTroll](https://www.amazon.com/inch-Pro-Troll-Hot-Chip-Flashers/dp/B00D989JJI/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=flasher+protroll&qid=1548000400&s=Sports+%26+Outdoors&sr=1-14)
        * Some of these ProTrolls have lights ($$$) and some claim to have chips that mimic bait fish electrical........
      * Also some anecdotal support for smaller 8 inch flashers
    * lures
      * a lot of what i see starts by recommending spoons
        * downrigger -- 15 feet -- 11" ProTroll flasher -- 26 -- 36" leader -- spoon + scent + garlic powder
        * [Coho Killer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0778YSFJH/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_2?smid=AGEU5BOCQ1AB8&psc=1)
          * "Finish" recs include Irish Cream, Cookies N Cream, Water Melon, Chrome, White Lightning
        * Bigger bait? 
          * [Ace Hi Fly with UV finish](https://www.amazon.com/Silver-Horde-Ace-Fly-Lures/dp/B00AU5W72E/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ace+hi+fly&qid=1547854281&s=Sports+%26+Outdoors&sr=1-2-catcorr)
            * This is related to Jeramy's rig?
        * Calamari plugs (?) 10 feet higher than above; no flasher; 40 feet behind the downrigger
        * [Irish Flag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CZDPK0U/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_1?smid=A3UMG32GFS0Y7X&psc=1) 
          * 3.5" or 4" spoon also from Silver Horde
          * See above on finishes people like (no word from the salmon on what they like)
        * Replace the standard King Fisher spoon with the “Tail Wagger” Hoochie Hook with #15 Octopus Squid Skirt on the hook
          * slow the spoon’s action at a faster trolling speed.
        * Needlefish Hoochie or Needlefish Ace-Hi Fly in a green spatter back finish. 
          * With tandem-tied 4/0 Owner SSW Cutting Point hooks 32 inches behind an 11-inch flasher
        * bait: particularly green-label / plug-cut herring
          * tandem-tied 3/0 or 3/0-4/0 Owner Cutting Point hooks tied on 20-pound monofilament leader material.       
          * 7- to 9-foot leader with a Sampo or Penn ball-bearing swivel in the middle and a No. 5 barrel swivel at the top end
            * for quick connection to the ball-bearing swivel and Duo-Lock snap at the end of his main line
          * Another plug cut green-label style is...
            * 2 Mustad UltraPoint hooks so that it spins in a tight circle even at slow speed. 
            * 3/0 hook in front and a 2/0 in back. 
            * A six-foot leader of Berkley Big Game UltraClear or 15-pound fluorocarbon runs to...
            * a swivel that connects leader to main line
              * six-bead swivel chains 
              * if 2 or 3 become tangled with grass the others will continue to work and reduce or eliminate line twist
            * Snap line into downrigger release about 25 feet behind the ball (seems to be no-flasher)
            * fish with the current five to 10 feet off the bottom whenever and wherever possible 
        * 3.5-inch or 4-inch Coyote Spoon 
          * chartreuse/fish-scale finish (color #0580) behind an 11-inch Pro-Troll HotChip Flasher in Green Stryper
          * About 42 inches of 30-pound Berkley Big Game UltraClear monofilament separates the flasher from the spoon. I smear a little Smelly Jelly (usually herring or anchovy scent, although I doubt that it makes a whole lot of difference what flavor you use) on the concave (chrome) side of the spoon, and a little more near the tail end of the flasher.

> I mentioned the fact that I like the “older” Coyotes, of which I still have dozens stashed away in my boat and in my shop, because, quite frankly, the newer ones (which aren’t made in Hood River anymore) don’t work very well for me. Knowing that my old Coyotes will some day be gone, I’ve been experimenting with Silver Horde/Gold Star’s Sonic Edge spoons, which feature a small blade on the hook ring, similar to the Coyote, and I like what I’m seeing. It may not be long before they make their way to the top of my blackmouth-getter list.

> In the past I’ve had some problems with line-twist while using my spoon-and-flasher rigs, so I now tie a size 3 Sampo or Berkley ball-bearing swivel in-line, about a foot above the flasher. I don’t like running the risk of hindering the action of an attractor or lure by adding too much weight directly to it, and that’s why the swivel goes up the line a ways rather than using a snap-swivel attached directly to the top of the flasher. But don’t tie the swivel too far above the flasher; making the entire rig too long which could cause problems when you’re trying to get a hooked salmon close enough for netting.

> As in most of the trolling I do for Chinook any time of year, I like to troll for blackmouth with or across the current rather than into it, but even if I’m trolling against the flow I usually gauge my speed by the angle of my downrigger cable, not by the numbers my electronics are giving me. The flasher and spoon typically work best for me when that entry angle is about 25 degrees, and I typically achieve that line angle at a boat speed of 1.7 to 2.2 miles per hour. That speed, though, may vary greatly if I’m going with or against the current.

> Most of the fishing I do is in 70 to 120 feet of water, and most of the time I try to keep the downrigger ball within 10 feet of the bottom. Of course, if I start marking fish or bait consistently at some depth higher in the water column, I may hit the “up” button on at least one downrigger and get a lure up to where the action might be. There’s a pretty good chance that those mid-level marks are shakers, though, and sub-legal Chinook have no qualms about smacking a 3 ½- or 4-inch spoon, so if I start hooking a lot of little salmon at those middle depths I send the gear back down and continue looking for larger prey.
